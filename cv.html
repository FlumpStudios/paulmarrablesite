					<h1>Personal Profile</h1>
				</div>
				
				<div class="sectionContent">
				     <p>I am currently a senior server developer for the live services department at Codemasters in Southam. I also run an independent video game studio called Flump Studios.</p>

					<p>	I have been developing software and games for over 25 years and I have maintained a strong passion for software development, with the art of clean coding being of particular interest. Over the years I have gained experience developing with C#, C++, Javascript, Typescript, Python, VB, Lua, Unity 3D, HTML, CSS, SASS, AngularJS, ReactJS, ASP.Net, SQL and various other languages and frameworks.</p>
						
					<p>	As a web developer, my current preferred stack is C# .Net Core 3+ , Entity FW core and ReactJS with Redux. </p>

					<h2>Senior server web developer</h2>
					<p class="subDetails"> July 2020- Present</p>
					<p>
						After a few months as a full stack developer, the senior server developer at the time decided to leave the company, moving over the server role seemed like a 
						perfect fit as I had spent most of my time server-side and it's where I felt my skills were best developed.
					  </br>
					  The role has been proven challenging but rewarding, as there is no technical personnel above me, in my department, I report directly to management and am in charge of 
					  any technical decisions that need to be made regarding our server architecture.
					</br>
					The tech - .Net Core, .Net FW 4.x, REST services, SOAP services(WCF), RabbitMq, Dapper, ADO.net, Entity framework, MongoDB, Teamcity, Octopus deploy and many more.

					<h2>Senior full stack web developer</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">Feb 2020-  July 2020</p>
					<p>My role at Codemasters has proven to be more varied than my previous roles and has me jumping from web API and app development to game server development, from architecting large projects and databases to client side coding and even the occasional desktop app. I use a range of technology and stacks at Codemasters, but the majority of my time is spent with .NET core 3.1, MSSQL and ReactJS</p>
